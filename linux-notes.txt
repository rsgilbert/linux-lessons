### mv ###
mv command: For moving files/directories.
mv dir1 dir2 (dir2 exists)
if dir2 exists, move dir1 into dir2. So no renaming. New path to file a.txt originally in dir1 is dir2/dir1/a.txt

mv dir1 dir2 (dir2 doesnt exist)
If dir2  does not exist, Create dir2 and move contents of dir1 into dir2. In other words rename dir1 title to dir2 title.
If a.txt is originally in dir1, new path to a.txt after move is dir2/a.txt
