// ## su
// Start a shell as another user
// Login to root is disabled by default so we will have to prepend with sudo
// so we can be granted superuser priviledges
sudo su -
// Or
sudo su -l


Run one command as superuser
sudo su -c 'ls -l /root'

// ## sudo 
// Allow an ordinary user execute commands as a different user(usually superuser) in a very controlled way.
// The ordinary user authenticates using their own password and not the password of the superuser
sudo ls /root

// To see what priviledges are granted by sudo
sudo -l
