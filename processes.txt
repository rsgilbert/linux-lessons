// ## Controlling processes
// Politely ask a program to terminate  
// Interrupt signal (INT)
Ctrl+C 
// Or 
kill -s INT %1
// Or
kill -s SIGINT %1
// Or (using signal number)
kill -n 2 %1
// Or
kill -INT %1
// Or 
kill -2 %1

// Run program xlogo from the foreground
xlogo

// Run program xlogo placing it in the background
xlogo &

// List jobs that have been launched from our terminal
jobs

// Return a process to the foreground
// Lets suppose its job number (called jobspec) is 1
fg %1

// Stop a process without terminating it
// Allows a foreground process to be moved to the background
// Terminal Stop signal (TSTP)
Ctrl + Z
Or
kill -s TSTP %1

// Move stopped process to foreground
fg %1

// Move stopped process to background
bg %1
// Similar to
kill -CONT %1

// ## Signals 
// kill is used to send signals
// Terminate programs that need killing (using signals)
// Terminate signal (TERM)
kill 53073
// Or
kill -TERM 53073

// Terminate program by specifying its jobspec (using signals)
kill %1


// Hungup signal. 
// Identical to closing a terminal
kill -s HUP %2

// KILL signal
// Termination of program is performed by kernel immediately. Program is not given time to cleanup after itself
kill -s KILL 46431

Or (using signal number)
kill -n 9 46431

// List signal numbers 
kill -l

// Stop (pause) a process
// STOP signal is sent to the kernel so it can not be ignored
kill -STOP 63866


// Continue (resume) a process 
kill -CONT 64866

// Terminate program by asking it politely. Give it time to clean up 
kill -TERM %1

// Kill multiple processes
kill %5 %6 %7

// Or
killall xlogo

// See process tree 
pstree

// Snapshot of system resources usage

// To get timely updates (in seconds intervals eg after every 4 seconds)
